BCBS Idaho Family Medicine Providers

Okay, I have reviewed the file listing Family Medicine providers near Boise, Idaho. Here's a breakdown of the Quality Assurance findings, focusing primarily on duplicate entries and other potential data issues:
Duplicate Provider Entries
Based on the National Provider Identifier (NPI), which is the most reliable unique identifier, I found several providers listed multiple times. These fall into two main categories:
1. Providers Listed at Different Locations: Many providers appear more than once because they practice at multiple locations within the 50-mile search radius. While their NPI is duplicated in the list, each entry corresponds to a distinct practice address. This isn't necessarily a data error but reflects the provider's multiple practice sites. Examples include:
    * Michael J Twomey (NPI 1073924239): Page 22 (Boise) and Page 98 (Nyssa, OR)
    * Sheila M Giffen (NPI 1013957802): Page 52 (Boise) and Page 102 (Ontario, OR)
    * Andrew L Bennett (NPI 1588036396): Page 92 (Emmett) and Page 101 (Ontario, OR)
    * Bryon D Hemphill (NPI 1598707226): Page 92 (Emmett) and Page 101 (Ontario, OR)
    * Elisa A Peavey (NPI 1740508480): Page 92 (Emmett) and Page 101 (Ontario, OR)
    * Garth G Gulick (NPI 1710188032): Page 93 (Emmett) and Page 99 (Nyssa, OR)
    * Shannon D Schantz (NPI 1215907704): Page 93 (Emmett) and Page 98 (Nyssa, OR)
    * Michael E Graff (NPI 1689603219): Page 96 (Caldwell) and Page 102 (Ontario, OR)
    * Morris H Smith (NPI 1487611877): Page 99 (Nyssa, OR) and Page 102 (Ontario, OR)
    * (Similar patterns exist for facilities listed multiple times at different locations, e.g., Valley Family Health Care Inc)
2. Potential True Duplicate Entries (Data Errors): These providers appear multiple times with the same NPI and the same practice address. This suggests a data entry or report generation error where the same record was included twice.
    * Paul C Gering Jr (NPI 1235198995): Appears on Pages 102 and 103 with the same Ontario, OR address.
    * Christine E Davenport Welter (NPI 1659831386): Appears on Pages 101 and 102 with the same Ontario, OR address. (Note: The second entry on page 101 seems identical to the first entry on page 102, perhaps a formatting/scan artifact).
    * David W Brauer (NPI 1295718096): Appears twice consecutively on Page 103 with the same Ontario, OR address.
Other Data Quality Issues Noted
Beyond strict duplicates, here are other potential issues with the data:
1. Incorrect Location Data:
    * Several entries list addresses as "Virtual Care Only, Unknown, FL 99999" but are given a distance of 5.18 miles from Boise, ID. This is clearly incorrect data.
        * Dynamic Health and Wellness Inc (Page 53)
        * Ormond Medical Arts Family Practice (Page 53)
        * We Care Family Physicians Llc (Page 53)
2. NPI Number Issue:
    * On Page 70, Laura Reis, DO (Provider) and Eagle TMS Therapy (Facility) are both listed with the exact same NPI number (1902139066). Individual providers (Type 1 NPI) and facilities (Type 2 NPI) should have distinct NPIs. This indicates a significant data error for one or both entries.
3. Timeliness/Network Status Notes:
    * The report includes specific warnings that certain providers will no longer accept the searched network after specific dates in 2025. This is important context for anyone using this list near those dates.
        * Bruce L Belzer (Page 49): After May 31, 2025
        * Veronica C Lawrence (Page 67): After July 1, 2025
        * Wade M Bateman (Page 67): After June 30, 2025
4. Facility vs. Professional Listings:
    * The list includes both individual providers ("Professional") and clinics/groups ("Facility"). This is expected, but be aware when analyzing counts or specific provider details. Some facilities are also listed multiple times due to different locations (e.g., Valley Family Health Care Inc on pages 98 and 101).
5. "Board Certification: None":
    * Numerous providers are listed with "Board Certification: None". While this can be accurate (e.g., for residents, fellows, or providers between certifications), it's a recurring data point you might want to be aware of.
Summary
The primary issue regarding duplicates involves a few likely data entry errors where the same provider at the same location is listed twice (Gering, Davenport Welter, Brauer). Many other "duplicates" identified by NPI are actually the same provider listed correctly at multiple practice locations.
Significant data quality concerns include the entries with Florida addresses and the shared NPI between Laura Reis and Eagle TMS Therapy. The network departure notes are also crucial pieces of QA information.
Let me know if you'd like a more detailed look at any specific entry!
